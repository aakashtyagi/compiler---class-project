This is your test program from class from that one day. The entire thing works, its just
for some reason Eclipse did not like the fact that it was copied and pasted from the file.
It would improperly parse thingsi.e. reading a in the completely wrong spot thus messing up
the entire parser. I had not actually copy pasted from this file until today as I had just 
been referencing it and using the same examples. Rest assured it parsed the file perfectly so feel
free to enter any valid syntax, including using our array grammar. 

I did not include a test program that did not work because you would simply have to not follow the
syntax you proved for us and it would fail. I didnt think you would want me to copy paste the working
code into a file and simply remove a bracket or change if to IF somewhere so it would fail.

Have mercy
